SpringViz is free (as in beer) software (if you can call an XSLT "software").

I basically stole the approach for SpringViz from Eric Burke's 
(http://www.ericburke.com/) "antgraph" utility, and applied it to 
Spring Framework configurations.

Props go to AT&T for making GraphViz and the "dot" notation available as Open Source.

If you find SpringViz of use, attribution would be nice.  Thanks.
